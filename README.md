## Client did not pay?


Add opacity to the body tag and decrease it every day until their site completely fades away. Set a due date and customize the number of days you offer them until the website is fully vanished. 


```javascript
// Change the following variables as you need
const dueDate = new Date('2019-02-8'); // The Date when you wish to fade out the site
const deadline = 0; // Set a deadline for payment
```

## Usage
Just load the not-paid.js file at the end of ```<body>```
